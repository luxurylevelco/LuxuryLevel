          Luxury Souq: A Trusted Destination for Luxury Watches and Jewelry
        </p>
        <p>
          The CEO of Luxury Souq, Mr. Khaled Ebrahimi, is an Emirati businessman
          with a deep passion for luxury watches. His love for these exquisite
          timepieces comes from his father, who belongs to a family with a long
          history in the watch trading industry.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          To pursue his lifelong passion, he traveled to Switzerland to earn a
          Master’s Degree in International Business, specializing in Luxury
          Goods Management. Additionally, he graduated from the International
          Geneva Institute (IGI) with expertise in gemology, including diamond
          polishing and colored stone grading.

        <p>
          Mr. Khaled Ebrahimi is not just a businessman, but also someone who
          loves to travel and explore. He enjoys attending international watch
          exhibitions worldwide, including in Hong Kong, Miami, New York,
          Germany, and Switzerland. Through these events, he not only indulges
          in his hobby of collecting watches but also has the opportunity to
          meet new people and establish connections.

        <p>
          With his passion for luxury watches and desire to make a mark in the
          industry, Mr. Khaled Ebrahimi embarked on building a Luxury Souq.
          Armed with his knowledge and a clear vision, he started with a rented
          space of 1500 square feet and a team of only five employees, including
          himself. Through hard work and unwavering determination, his efforts
          paid off.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Luxury Souq has established a reputation for offering some of
          the rarest, most authentic, and high-quality pre-owned Swiss-made
          watches and other luxury goods, all at competitive prices in the
          market.
